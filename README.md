This repository contains my write-ups on labs solved on the [PortSwigger Web Security Academy](https://portswigger.net/web-security/nosql-injection/lab-nosql-injection-detection) platform. I share my own resolution methods, sometimes different (and sometimes longer) than those proposed by the platform. The goal is to document my learning, to explore and understand in depth web vulnerabilities, techniques to exploit them, and to share my experiences with the community.

# Organization

You will always find the presence of two tabs in my write-ups. No need for detailed explanations: the names speak for themselves. This organization allows a better visibility of my future actions:

- `Normal Request`
- `Malicious Request`
